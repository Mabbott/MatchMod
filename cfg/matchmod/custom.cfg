tv_autorecord	"0"	// Records every game, demo file name format is auto-YYYYMMDD-hhmm-map.dem
tv_chatgroupsize	"0"	// Set chat group size to n spectators. Only spectators in the same chat group can speak to each other. Chat groups are turned off with "tv_chatgroupsize 0" and everybody can speak to everybody. Setting chat groups helps reducing chatter noise and saves some bandwidth.
tv_chattimelimit	"8"	// Limits spectators to chat only every n seconds

tv_dispatchmode	"0"	// Sets Source client dispatch mode for connecting clients: 0=never, 1=if appropriate, 2=always

tv_snapshotrate	"16"	// Sets world snapshots broadcasted per second by SourceTV (master only)
tv_transmitall	"1"	// By default entities and events outside of the auto-director view are removed from SourceTV broadcasts to save bandwidth. If tv_transmitall is enabled, the whole game is transmitted and spectators can switch their view to any player they want. This option increases bandwidth requirement per spectator client by factor 2 to 3
